# Weather-App

A weather web app fetches real-time weather data based on user input, typically a city name or location. It integrates with APIs like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI to retrieve current weather conditions, forecasts, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details. The app features a search bar where users can enter their desired location, and upon submission, it dynamically updates the UI with fetched weather data. It may also use geolocation services to automatically detect the userâ€™s location. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React or Vue.js), while the backend, if needed, handles API requests and caching. The app may include additional functionalities such as displaying hourly or weekly forecasts, weather alerts, and unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. A clean and responsive UI ensures accessibility on various devices, and animations or icons enhance the user experience.
